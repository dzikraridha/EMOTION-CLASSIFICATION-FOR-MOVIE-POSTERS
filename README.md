# EMOTION CLASSIFICATION FOR MOVIE POSTERS 

This project focuses on developing an AI-based system to predict the emotions experienced by viewers when observing movie posters. The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with transfer learning using the VGG16 architecture to analyze visual elements of movie posters and classify associated viewer emotions. A comprehensive dataset preparation process was carried out, including mapping movie genres to emotions based on prior research, ensuring the model’s ability to generalize effectively. A user-friendly web application was built using Streamlit, enabling users to upload posters and receive real-time predictions of the emotions these posters are likely to evoke in viewers. The system was tested to ensure model’s accuracy and the system’s functionality. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of combining AI and visual media analysis to enhance audience engagement and emotional understanding in the entertainment industry.
